# NAME

LWP::UserAgent::Throttled - Throttle requests to a site

# VERSION

Version 0.05

# SYNOPSIS

Some sites with REST APIs, such as openstreetmap.org, will blacklist you if you do too many requests.
LWP::UserAgent::Throttled is a sub-class of LWP::UserAgent.

    use LWP::UserAgent::Throttled;
    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Throttled->new();
    $ua->throttle({ 'www.example.com' => 5 });
    print $ua->get('http://www.example.com');
    sleep (2);
    print $ua->get('http://www.example.com');   # Will wait at least 3 seconds before the GET is sent

# SUBROUTINES/METHODS

## send\_request

See [LWP::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent).

## throttle

Get/set the number of seconds between each request for sites.

    my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Throttled->new();
    $ua->throttle({ 'search.cpan.org' => 0.1, 'www.example.com' => 1 });
    print $ua->throttle('search.cpan.org'), "\n";    # prints 0.1

# BUGS

There is one global throttle level, so you can't have different levels for different sites.
